# Blackjack-Game-JS

Welcome to the classic Blackjack game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

## Game Overview

This project implements a simple yet engaging Blackjack game that allows players to start a game, draw cards, and experience the excitement of the popular casino game.

### Game Features

- **Start Game Button**: Clicking this button initiates the game and deals two random cards to the player.
- **New Card Button**: When the player's card sum is less than 21, this button allows them to draw a new random card.
- **Game Logic**: The game checks for Blackjack (a sum of 21) after dealing the initial cards and prompts the player accordingly. If the sum is below 21, the player is asked if they want to draw a new card. If the sum exceeds 21, the player is informed that they are out of the game.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and layout of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styles the game for an attractive and user-friendly presentation.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the game's functionality, including card dealing, sum calculation, and player interactions.
